client_node:
----
X We need to increment and store id numbers on packets (com server will maintain
one count, remote handler another, so we'll maintain counts per message type)
* we need to pass the event manager name through the arg list in the app
* we need to be able to pull the nodename from the erlang node
* pass servername/function into handlers also

command_node:
----
* need to port client_node code to command node
